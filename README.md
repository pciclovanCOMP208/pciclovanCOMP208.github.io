Hello!
Welcome to my COMP208 Assessment 1 - a Teaching Portfolio website.
I am only just starting out with learning how to design websites
using HTML and CSS, so hopefully this site works well on your device. 

I endeavour to improve my skills over the course of this unit, 
and hopefully I am able to employ my newly-acquired knowledge
productively in the future, especially in the teaching of 
Computing Technologies classes (if indeed I end up becoming a teacher). 

Thanks for your interest, and all the best, 
- Philip.

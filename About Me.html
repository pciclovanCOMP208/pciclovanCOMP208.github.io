												<h2>About Me</h2>
												<p><b>Third Year Education Student</b><br>
													This is the third year that I am studying at the Strathfield Campus of the Australian
													Catholic University. 
												</p>
											</header>

											<h4>Summary</h4>
											<p>
												I have always been fascinated by both the Arts and Sciences, and consistently demonstrated
												enthusiasm for thoroughly understanding any topic which draws my interest. For this reason,
												I have pursued degrees in both the Arts (Creative Arts) <br>and Science (Biology). Within
												these degrees, I also studied many of the '-ologies': Anthropology, Sociology, Psychology.
												<br>My current double-degree program will enable me to contribute to society through empowering
												young people to become future leaders in the world of Design and Technology - particularly
												through my specialisation as a <i>Food Technology</i> and <i>Textiles</i> teacher <br> in NSW secondary schools.
												Through my Computing minor, I will also be able to teach the new <i>Computing Technologies</i> Syllabus.
											</p>

											<p>
												I have a long-standing affinity for Music, Theatre, Performance, Literature, Visual Arts,
												and the Creative Process. <br>I am guided by logic in all that I do, favouring clear processes
												and well-developed plans. Despite enjoying creating opportunities for other people, and
												understanding the importance of accommodating the needs of target clients, I am 
												an introvert at heart: <br>able to happily work alone, or as part of a small, cohesive team.
